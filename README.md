# Media-Rental-Manager-OOP
**Important Note:** Requires JavaFX to work.


A media rental manager program that allows a store to store customers, different media (movies, games and songs) and what they have in their carts and what they've rented.

This project was used to implement my understanding of Object Oriented concepts. I used JavaFX where I built the GUI by hand.

Not a very good project it was one of the first I made when I was first learning Java, OOP and JavaFX. Taught me a lot.
